# Notes

**TODO:**

- Combine *map.directive.ts* with the *RiderRequest* component. I don't think we need a directive anymore. We should be able to handle everything in the component directly.
- Fix the tests for the *RiderRequest* component and **GoogleMapsService*.
- Write the instructions.
- Split the *taxi-ng-app* repo into three parts.
- Replace *pytest* with the standard Django tests.
